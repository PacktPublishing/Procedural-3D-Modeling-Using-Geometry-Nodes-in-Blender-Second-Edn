Geometry Nodes are tools that enable you to manipulate and generate 3D geometry in a node-based workflow. In this updated edition, youâ€™ll learn how to use the basic and intermediate features of Geometry Nodes that are essential for creating complex, physics-based simulations and animations in Blender 4.5 LTS.
After an introduction to the Geometry Nodes system and its inner workings, youâ€™ll learn about different node inputs and outputs, along with the basic nodes necessary for your Geometry Nodes projects. Youâ€™ll apply your newfound knowledge through exercises that involve modifying curves, meshes, text, and more, as well as work on a range of interesting projects, including creating a procedural plant, a brick wall generator, and a procedural LED panel to explore different aspects of node-based modeling. The concluding chapters take you through a brand-new addition to Geometry Nodes called the Simulation Zone, where youâ€™ll create various physics simulations such as a procedural fountain and bugs crawling over objects using the Geometry Node editor.
By the end of this book, youâ€™ll be able to tackle minor to major Geometry Nodes issues with confidence and create complicated Geometry Nodes trees and complex physics simulations tailored to your needs.</details>

_Siemen Lens_ is a CG artist who excels at photorealism. Experiencing boredom during the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, he began learning Blender. He currently studies VFX in Kortrijk. His specialty is creating abstract yet photorealistic renders using Geometry Nodes, physics, texturing, and various other techniques in Blender. He also uses other software, such as DaVinci Resolve, Illustrator, Houdini, and Maya.
Siemen has worked as a product render designer in a furniture company. His goal is to create visually convincing CG art that is pleasing to the eye. For three years, he has familiarized himself with Blender, and today, with this book, he will familiarize you with Geometry Nodes.
